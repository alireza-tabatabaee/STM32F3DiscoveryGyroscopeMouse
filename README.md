# STM32F3Discovery Gyroscope Mouse

This is a mouse I built using the STM32F3Discovery board. It uses the on-board gyroscope and the USB functionality of ST microcontrollers to communicate with the computer. [You can watch it in action here.](https://youtu.be/8phq4F2TI2w)

Open the Keil project from the MDK-ARM folder, compile it, and enjoy using it.
